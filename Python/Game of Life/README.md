# Game of life

## Description

The Conway's game of life is a simple set of rules which behave like a celular automata, maybe It's the simplest celular automata known. The game is based on a bidimensional matrix which contais 0s or 1s, indicating wether the cell is alive (1 or true) or death (0 or false). With that and the following set of rules, the game is created:

* A death cell borns if is surrounded by exactly 3 alive cells
* An alive cell remains alive if is surrounded either by 2 or 3 alive cells, otherwise it deads.

It has been demostrated that this game is a complete turing machine, that means that any logic computation can be made with the game an it set of rules.
